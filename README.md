# Weather Outside

Weather Outside displays 5 days weather forecast for Munich. It get information from OpenWeatherMap API.
As the API has a diferent origin from this application, we are using a CORS Proxy backend to succefully fetch the API.

The proxy is only allowed to handle requests from the hosted Weather Outside application. If you want to use this application locally, run this project aside: https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere
